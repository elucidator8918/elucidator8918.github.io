In this 3month bootcamp, I covered essential topics in data structures and algorithms, focusing on graph-based algorithms, linked lists, pointers, and dynamic allocation. These fundamental concepts are crucial for understanding and implementing various algorithms efficiently.

The session provided a comprehensive tutorial on graph-based algorithms, including algorithms for traversal, shortest paths, and minimum spanning trees. Additionally, I discussed the concepts of linked lists, their implementations, and their applications in real-world scenarios. Moreover, I delved into pointers and dynamic allocation, explaining their importance in memory management and data structure implementations.

This session, organized for the Misahub DSA Bootcamp, aimed to equip participants with the necessary knowledge and skills to tackle algorithmic problems effectively. Attendees were encouraged to actively participate and engage in discussions to deepen their understanding of the topics covered.

For those interested in attending, the bootcamp session was conducted online, providing flexibility and accessibility to participants from various locations.
