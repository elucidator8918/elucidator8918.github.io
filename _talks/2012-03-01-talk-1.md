In this talk, I delved into the realm of quantum generative adversarial networks (qGANs) through a comprehensive tutorial on their implementation using Qiskit Machine Learning and PyTorch. QGANs, a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, offer a powerful approach to generative modeling tasks by leveraging the interplay between a quantum generator and a classical discriminator. The tutorial covered the entire workflow, from data preparation and neural network definitions to setting up the training loop and analyzing results.

This event, hosted by Thembelihle D. and co-organized by Mariki, attracted 82 attendees both online and in-person. Prerequisites for the talk included knowledge of quantum computing fundamentals and machine learning. Technologies covered during the presentation included Quantum Computing and Quantum Algorithms.

For those interested in attending, the event provided the option for in-person attendance at 45 Juta street, Braamfontein, Johannesburg central, or online attendance via webinar link provided upon RSVP.

Overall, the talk aimed to provide insights and practical guidance for implementing qGANs using PyTorch, contributing to the growing intersection of quantum computing and machine learning.
